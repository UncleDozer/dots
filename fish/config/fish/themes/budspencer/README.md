# Budspencer theme

A theme for the 70s, makes fish even more powerful. It's equipped with a few
nice functions and key bindings to speed up your workflow.

## Requirements

You need an up-to-date fish shell version from [github][fish-git] or a
[nightly build][fish-nightly].

Non standard tools:

* xsel
* wmctrl
* git
* [taskwarrior][taskwarrior] (optional)
* [remind][remind] (optional)

## Configuration

### General configuration

The theme behaves similar to vim's airline/powerline plugins. Thus, it needs a
[powerline font][font]. Although it works with emacs mode, it's more powerful
with vi mode. In order to enable vi mode, execute:
```
set -U fish_key_bindings fish_vi_key_bindings
```

### Colors

Redefine `$budspencer_colors` with the `set` command in order to change the
colors of the prompt.

Example:
```
set budspencer_colors 000000 333333 666666 ffffff ffff00 ff6600 ff0000 ff0033 3300ff 0000ff 00ffff
00ff00
```
will result in a prompt like this:
![color replace example][colors]

Two color schemes for bright and dark environments are predefined. You can
enable them with `day` and `night`, respectively.

### Command history
Commands that shouldn't appear in the command history are defined by a universal
list `$budspencer_nocmdhist`. Default:
```
set -U budspencer_nocmdhist c d ll ls m s
```

### Disable/reenable greeting

Disable:
```
set -U budspencer_nogreeting
```

Reenable:
```
set -e budspencer_nogreeting
```

## Outer prompt segments

- Vi mode is indicated by color of outer segments, cursor color also changes
  if terminal supports it:
    * blue: NORMAL mode
    * yellow: INSERT mode
    * magenta: VISUAL mode

## Left prompt segments

- Prompt line number
- Git repository information
- Status symbols
    * ✻: keep track of this shell session, can be toggled with `#` to show the number of
       the session within the sessions list
    * ⌘: present working directory is in bookmark list, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the number of the bookmark
    * V: vi is parent process
    * R: [ranger][ranger] is parent process
    * ⚙: there are background jobs, can be toggled with `#` to show the amount of
        background jobs
    * : no write permissions in present working directory
    * ⚔: there are tasks scheduled due today, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the amount of tasks
    * ⚑: there are appointments for today, can be toggled with `#` to
        show the amount of appointments
    * ✔: last command succeeded, can be toggled with `#` to show the status value
    * ✘: last command failed, can be toggled with `#` to show the status value
    * ⚡: superuser indicator
- Present working directory

## Right prompt segments

- Last command's duration time
- Git status symbols:
    * ↑: git repository is ahead origin
    * ↓: git repository is behind origin
    * +: changes have been added to git index
    * –: files have been deleted in work tree
    * ✱: files have been modified in work tree
    * →: files have been renamed in git index
    * ═: there are unmerged commits
    * ●: there are untracked (new) files
    * ✭: there are stashed commits

## Toggle prompt segments

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
- Style of "present working directory"-segment can be toggled in NORMAL and in
  VISUAL mode with space bar
    * styles implemented:
        - `short` (shows username, short hostname and truncated path; recommended in
          most cases)
        - `long` (shows username, full hostname and full path; useful for copy-paste
          in ssh connections)
        - `none` (shows nothing except small delimiter; useful for small terminals)
        - If prompt is toggled with `#`, the IP address is shown instead of the
          hostname.
    * configurable by universal list `$budspencer_pwdstyle` (if not set, defaults to
      `short long none`); note that changes to `$budspencer_pwdstyle` keep persistant as it's
      a universal variable.

- Style of symbols can be toggled in NORMAL and in VISUAL mode with `#`
    * styles implemented:
        - `symbols` (shows status symbols)
        - `numbers` (shows numbers instead of symbols in left prompt as well as amount of changes in
          right git prompt)

## Quickly navigate in history of working directories

The function `d` shows the history as enumerated list. Unlike fish's builtin
`dirh`, `d` does not show any duplicates. Enter a number to jump to a directory
within the list.

The following shortcuts need vi-mode:
- Press `H` in NORMAL mode to change present working directory to previous
  working directory in history.
- Press `L` in NORMAL mode to change present working directory to next working
  directory in history.

## Quickly navigate in command history

The function `c` shows the command history as enumerated list similarly to
the `d` function. Selections are also paste into the X clipboard. It's possible
to load a command of a former prompt by giving the prompt line number as
argument.

## Bookmarks

A bookmark can be created with `mark`. It can be removed with `unmark`.
Bookmarks are universal and thus persistant.
A new shell automatically changes working directory on startup to newest bookmark.
`m` is a function that shows the bookmarks as enumerated list equivalently to `d`.

The following shortcuts need vi mode:
- Create a bookmark for present working directory with `m` in NORMAL mode.
- Remove a bookmark for present working directory with `M` in NORMAL mode.

## Edit commandline with your favorite editor

The function `edit-commandline` let you edit the commandline with your editor.
It makes the commandline as powerful as your editor. If `$EDITOR` is not set,
vi is used.

The following shortcut needs vi mode:
- Type `.` in NORMAL mode to edit commandline in editor.

## Sessions

Shell session can be stored with `s <session name>`. If a session with `session
name` already exists, the session with this name will be attached. If a session with
`session name` is already active within another terminal, this terminal will be
focussed.

A list of available sessions can be shown with `s`.

A session can be erased with `s -e <session name>`.

Type `s -d` to detach current session.

## Set window title

Just type `wt <title>`.

## TODO

- vi REPLACE mode, as soon as REPLACE mode is implemented within fish
